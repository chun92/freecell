# Freecell Project

This project was operated by Hyunjoon Park for 2015 fall cs101 assignment in POSTECH.
The project is an imitation of Microsoft's freecell game and the game rule is simplied for novice programmers.
The project is written by C and visual framework is based on MS visual studio's consol. Sample project is also written as visual studio 2010 projects. The manual file is written in Korean.
