# Freecell Project

This project was made by Hyunjoon Park for 2015 fall cs101 assignment in POSTECH.
This is imitation of Microsoft's freecell game with simplifying the rules to lower the difficulty of project so that freshmen can finish their project easily.
The language is C and visual framework is based on visual studio's consol. Sample project is written based on visual studio 2010. The manual is written in Korean.

Thank you.
